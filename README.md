# sfHG1G2

The model **sfHG1G2** - *simultaneous fit HG1G2* - is a single fit across all apparitions/oppositions using the HG1G2 model, where the fitted **H** values can vary for each opposition, but **G1** and **G2** remain the same for all (Colazo et al., 2025, *Icarus*). This means we fit **N + 2 parameters**, where **N** is the number of oppositions.

While this code was originally developed in Colazo et al. (2025), where it was applied to the **ATLAS catalog V2** ([results here](https://osf.io/3624f)), this repository shows the implementation of the code for the **FINK broker** ([https://fink-portal.org/](https://fink-portal.org/)), which works with **ZTF data**. 

This implementation allows users to download the code and start using it directly, without needing to obtain additional `.csv`, `.dat`, or other data files.
