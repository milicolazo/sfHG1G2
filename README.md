# sfHG1G2
The model sfHG1G2 - simultaneous fit HG1G2 - is a single fit across all apparitions/oppositions using the HG1G2 model, where the fitted H values can vary for each opposition, but G1 and G2  remain the same for all (Colazo et al 2025). This means we fit N+2 parameters, where N is the number of oppositions.
